 *
 * Design contract (AC v2.1 + v2.4):
 * - `buildSpawnArgs` is PURE: returns the argv array for `claude -p` with no token in argv.
 * - `dispatchHand` is INJECTABLE: the `spawn` parameter defaults to a thin spawnSync wrapper
 *   so unit tests can pass a FAKE spawn that captures args/env without launching a real process.
 * - Token flows ONLY through child env (ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN), never in argv, brief, or settings.
 * - Brief/shared_context are scrubbed of the token before being written to disk.
 * - Ephemeral CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (mkdtemp) is seeded from the hand-config template, the
 *   Stop-hook command resolved via resolveHookCommand, and torn down in a finally block.
 * - Dependency-free: only node builtins (fs, os, path, child_process).
