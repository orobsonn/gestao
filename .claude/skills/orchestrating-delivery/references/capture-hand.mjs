/**
 * @description Independent post-hoc CAPTURE for a finished cheap-hand child — the GATE OF
 * RECORD in the "strong eyes, cheap hands" model. After the Ollama hand exits, the HARNESS
 * (never the model's prose) builds the child result that feeds the fail-closed `evaluateRun`
 * from `./dispatch-hand.mjs`:
 *
 *   1. PRECONDITION (fail-closed): HEAD must still equal the recorded freeze baseline —
 *      `git.headSha() === freezeCommitSha`. The hand has no git/Bash, so HEAD MUST still be the
 *      freeze-commit; a divergent HEAD means a rogue commit ran and we cannot anchor a diff to
 *      the baseline → abort to a CRITICAL EXCEPTION, NEVER stamping `captured:true`. We do NOT
 *      assert a clean tree here: ensuring a CLEAN baseline BEFORE the hand spawns is the
 *      orchestrator's / spawn-hand's responsibility (the freeze-commit guarantees HEAD is clean
 *      before the hand runs). Post-hoc, the tree is EXPECTED to be dirty — that dirt IS the
 *      hand's work, and capturing it is precisely this function's job.
 *   2. SNAPSHOT touchedPaths = UNION of tracked changes (`git diff --name-only <sha>`) and
 *      untracked files (`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`). A brand-new untracked
 *      file is real work — it must be captured, not read as an empty diff. The snapshot is
 *      taken BEFORE running the frozen test, which may itself write fixtures. A gitignored
 *      out-of-scope write (which `--exclude-standard` hides) is recovered via a no-exclude
 *      sweep (`git ls-files --others`) and appended when it falls OUTSIDE `scope_paths`, so
 *      `checkScope` in `evaluateRun` flags it instead of letting it escape.
 *   3. RUN the frozen test BY PATH via the injected `testRunner`, parse stdout for `# tests N`.
 *      N === 0 (zero collected tests) is a VACUOUS-GREEN guard: never a pass, even on exit 0 —
 *      it is forced to a non-zero locked-test exit so `evaluateRun` yields FAILED.
 *   4. BUILD the harness-controlled child: `{ captured:true, touchedPaths, lockedTestExitCode,
 *      exitCode, stdout, stderr }`. The model's prose NEVER populates touchedPaths or the
 *      locked-test exit — those come only from the independent git snapshot + frozen-test run.
 *   5. FEED the existing `evaluateRun({ dispatch, child })`.
 *
 * SECURITY (load-bearing): the Ollama auth token leaks NOWHERE. Live tee lines are redacted
 * per-line via `redact` BEFORE reaching the injected `logSink` (not only before disk). On-disk
 * artifacts (result.json + cost NDJSON) are written into an ephemeral mkdtemp dir with
 * `redactDeep` over the result and per-line redaction over the cost stream; the dir is torn
 * down in `finally` unless the caller opts to keep it (still token-free).
 *
 * Every dependency — `git`, `testRunner`, `logSink`, `fs` — is INJECTABLE; the real defaults
 * wrap child_process/fs but are NOT exercised by `node --test` (fakes drive every test).
